This folder contain 3 files for image classification of MNIST data-
tensorflow_tutorial.py - Classifying mnist using just the softmax function
tensorfolw_mnist1.py - Classifying mnist using multiple fully connected layers
tensorfolw_mnist2.py - Classifying mnist using convolutional neural networks
Keras_MNIST_1.py - Classifying mnist using Keras 

You can go on and play with the code add more layers, change optimizer etc and see how the test accuracy increases or decreases. Below are results of some of my experiments-

tensorfolw_mnist1.py - 0.977 with 2 hidden layers of 100 and 50 neurons, relu activation with dropout. 
tensorfolw_mnist2.py - 0.9921 in 56mins with 20000 iterations
Keras_MNIST_1.py - 0.9844 on the test test
